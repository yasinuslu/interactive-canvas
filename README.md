# Interactive Editor for canvas

This is the starting point of a project inspired by this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwXt90ZqA

## What's done
- This is a prototype that doesn't currently work
- currently we have a `createSession` function that creates a drawing session with a fake canvas context.
- You write some canvas drawing code in code.js.txt and press run you'll have your frame recorded to play in a real canvas
- Currently we record 1 frame

## TODO
- record 60 * 5 (5 seconds of a canvas) frames and play it in a canvas
- add items to this todo :D
